## Deliverables

### Optimization

- Switched to `node:18-slim` for a minimal base image  
- Used multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime layers  
- Used `.dockerignore` to exclude `node_modules`, logs, and unnecessary files  
- Used `npm ci` for faster, cache-friendly, and deterministic installs  
- Omitted dev dependencies using `NODE_ENV=production`  
- Used a non-root user for security

### Comparison with baseline image size

### How to build and run the image locally

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t shoppingkaro-optimized .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 optimized
```


## Usage

All the manifests are present in the k8s directory. For easy understanding, I've created different manifests in order to make it easy for beginners to understand easily.

### Apply k8s manifests

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### Access the Running Service - If using NodePort

```bash
kubectl get svc
# Then open in browser: http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
```

If using Ingress

```bash
kubectl get ingress
# Then open in browser: http://<Ingress Host or IP>
```

## Minimal Flow Diagram

## Justification of Architectural Choices

### Workload Types

1. **Node.js App**: Used `Deployment` for stateless, horizontally scalable services.  
2. **MongoDB**: Used `StatefulSet` to maintain persistent identity and stable storage.

### Networking and Scalability Decisions

1. Used `Service (ClusterIP)` for internal MongoDB access  
2. Used `Ingress` for external access to Node.js app  
3. Enabled `HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)` for app scalability based on CPU usage

### Security Measures

1. Dockerfile runs as non-root, minimizes attack surface  
2. `.dockerignore` and no dev dependencies reduce vulnerabilities  
3. Kubernetes `Secrets` used for sensitive data (DB credentials, JWT secrets)  
4. MongoDB not exposed externally

### Challenges Faced and Resolutions

1. **MongoDB Connection Issue**  
   - **Issue**: MongoDB wouldn't connect due to missing DNS or incorrect credentials  
   - **Resolution**: Defined correct internal service name and injected credentials via `Secrets`

2. **Image Layer Caching Issue**  
   - **Issue**: Image layer caching wasnâ€™t working  
   - **Resolution**: Re-ordered Dockerfile layers and used `npm ci`

3. **Liveness Probe Restarts**  
   - **Issue**: Liveness probe caused unnecessary restarts  
   - **Resolution**: Tuned probe parameters (`initialDelaySeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `failureThreshold`)

## AWS Cloud Deployment Readiness

### AWS Services

1. `EKS`: To run Kubernetes workloads  
2. `RDS` (Mongo-compatible or self-hosted on EC2): For MongoDB  
3. `S3`: For static assets and backup  
4. `ALB + Ingress Controller`: For external traffic routing  
5. `CloudWatch`: For centralized logging and monitoring

## Load Testing Strategy

### Tool Choice and Why

- Chose `k6` for its developer-friendly scripting in JavaScript, good CLI UX, and CI integration.

### Test Design

- Simulate 100 RPS with ramp-up and ramp-down  
- Test endpoints: `/api/products`, `/api/users/login`, `/api/orders`  
- Duration: 10 minutes with varying concurrency levels

### Metrics Monitored

- Response time (P95 latency)  
- Error rate  
- CPU/memory usage of pods  
- Throughput (requests per second)

### Scaling Decisions

- Based on peak CPU/memory, adjusted resource requests/limits  
- HPA thresholds configured to trigger additional replicas during high load  
- MongoDB storage size and IOPS benchmarked to avoid bottlenecks
